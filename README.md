# Denial-of-Service-DoS-DDoS-
A denial of service attack floods a website with a huge amount of Internet traffic, causing its servers to become overwhelmed and crash. Most DDoS attacks are carried out using computers that have been compromised with malware. The owners of infected computers may not even be aware that their machine is sending requests for data to your website.  Denial of service attacks can be prevented by:  Rate limiting your web serverâ€™s router Adding filters to your router to drop packets from dubious sources Dropping spoofed or malformed packets Setting more aggressive timeouts on connections Using firewalls with DDoS protection Using third-party DDoS mitigation software from Akamai, Cloudflare, VeriSign, Arbor Networks or another provider
